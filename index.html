        <!--Introduction-->
        <h2 class="title" id="intro1">Why I made this mod?</h2>
        <p class="content">
            Gregg Shorthand is great and fast and amazing overall but sometimes it is difficult to differentiate symbols
            and characters. Such as the letter "A", "E" and the big "A". Or strokes like "B" and "P" are mistakenly
            written.
            <br><br>
            This mod may help with these problems but may hinder speed. The good thing about this mod, it helps reduce
            space consumed and improve readability to some degree... Hopefully.

            The concepts here won't be over-discussed with great explanation or strict rulings to follow, you may even
            break some of these custom made rules/mod and modify the system more according to what you think is great.

            1) For people who mostly writes in full and not in briefs<br>
            2) For people trying to save space on the page or paper<br>
            3) For people who struggles to differentiate letters and characters<br>

            <!--Introduction to alternate letters-->
            Alternate letters may help reduce using space especially when you are trying to form a word, and there is
            text above it and sometimes conflicts with it or you feel the stroke is unnecessary long and don't know the
            brief of it.

            Generally I use some of these frequently and some not so much, so it's up to you whether you want to use it
            or not, but I will have a rating system of whether its good to use it: Great, Neutral, Bad.
            <br><br>
            Well... <span style="color: red;font-weight: bold;">Bad ones are bad</span>, but they are good to save speed
            but the benefit is rather not great of an effort
            and better to learn its brief of it, if it has any.
            <br><br>
            <span style="color: green;font-weight: bold;">Great meaning,</span> I use it quite a lot when I am freestyle
            writing and don't know the brief to that word. And it is quite practical to use it at least for my
            preference.

            <br><br>
            As for <span style="color: orange;font-weight: bold;">neutral rating</span>, I kinda use it but mehhh. So
            it's pretty much up to you.

            mechanical stenography (On a laptop keyboard via Plover). The letter Z or S is hard to differentiate from X
            or you can easily mess up the stroke.

            'Journey of encoding'
            <br><br>
            Typing which used to be fun and somewhat "relaxing",
            no longer is,
            because my hands are getting tired from typing from each stroke.
            <br><br>
            Even if I were to get a mechanical keyboard, doubt it will do much.
            From peak typing speeds of 75WPM and I am thankful for reaching such since that was my goal when I was
            younger and should appreciate it,
            though to my lows of potential 30s to 40s which are relatively slow, all because my fingers can't take much
            more.
            <br><br>
            Through all this pain, tried doing mechanical stenography, it was great but the effort of collective fingers
            pushing down on the keyboard of my laptop and its inefficient NKRO layout,
            If I could've got a real steno keyboard, things might change but for now, that's out of my reach.
            Might be should I just think my thoughts and never to inscribe them elsewhere...
            or should just quit typing altogether...
            <br><br>
            And here I found Shorthand writing, you don't get collective effort of 2 hands but one is enough,
            even if you won't get the peak writing speed of 300WPM as the professionals have reached.
            The average of one is around that of 60-100, and that's around a none strict learning journey of 6-12months.
            <br><br>
            And plus the stress on writing isn't on your fingers, it's your wrists which ache and tire.
            For the fingers only glide the direction for where they'll turn. And as of now, I write in Gregg shorthand
            for around a 3 month non strict learning journey around 25WPM average for freestyle writing and around 40WPM
            for practiced phrases and quotes.
            And with all this it doesn't do much strain or even no strain at all to my fingers nor my wrist, since I've
            not reached any major writing speeds like beyond the hundreds, yet unlike with normal writing in english.
            around 35-38WPM with a messy handwriting but readable for myself though a strugggle for some who may read.
            And when my speeds are in the slumps because of tiring and repetitive copying then writing, looking back and
            forth, just to copy some notes... down I go to 17.
            <br><br>
            Oh man, huh, sure is not great. I would say to conclude this writing that shorthand has not changed my life
            drastically but it has it benefits to a beginner regardless, being:
            reduced strain & stress,
            can write personal encoded messages,
            can enjoy freestyle writing for fun. And a bit more.
            <br><br>
            still more to know and explore. After all different writing systems may not be for all but a great option
            for those who may seek it, whether for one's own career, hobby or just the things in between. - Sincerely,
            DaKi
